**poddiy** offers a simple refund policy: you can cancel your subscription at any time and receive a prorated refund for any unused portion of your current billing period.

**Here's how it works:**

* If you cancel your subscription before the end of your billing period, you will receive a refund for the remaining days in that period.
* We do not offer refunds for previous billing periods.
* Refunds are typically processed within 5 business days.

**Please note:**

* This policy applies to all poddiy subscriptions.
* Free trials are not eligible for refunds.

**For any questions regarding refunds, please contact us at [help@poddiy.xyz](mailto:help@poddiy.xyz).**

This keeps it clear and concise. Users understand they can cancel anytime and get money back for the unused part of their current billing cycle.
